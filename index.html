      <h3>Building a restful WordPress API</h3>

      <p>
        This tutorial will walk through building the
        <a href="https://github.com/beezee/WP-Restful-Resource-API">WP Restful Resource API</a>
        plugin using the <a href="https://github.com/beezee/WPSpokes">WPSpokes</a> MVC framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this walkthrough, you will have a running start building scalable web applications
        inside WordPress using the WPSpokes framework, with help from the
        <a href="#">framework docs</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Scope of the Project</h4>
      <p>
        The tutorial is broken up into two parts, each of which will produce a
        related set of functionality, and expose you to related parts of the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        In part 1, you will become familiar with bootstrapping a WPSpokes-based plugin,
        utilizing the WPSpokes router, and controllers to add urls to your WordPress site
        whose behavior you control using a standard MVC approach. At the end of part 1,
        your plugin will include the following features:

        <ul>
          <li>Restful resources for the following WordPress data types</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Posts</li>
              <li>Users</li>
              <li>Categories</li>
              <li>Tags</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The following url structure for each restful resource</li>
            <ul>
              <li>POST to /api/{{data type}} to create new</li>
              <li>GET to /api/{{data type}} to retrieve a list of instances</li>
              <li>PUT to /api/{{data type}}/:id to update an instance</li>
              <li>GET to /api/{{data type}}/:id to retrieve an instance</li>
              <li>DELETE to /api/{{data type}}/:id to delete an instance</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>All API endpoints will respond with JSON</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        In part 2, you will become familiar with WPSpokes view handling, including the 
        excellent <a href="https://github.com/Anahkiasen/former">former</a> library included
        with WPSpokes for handling forms based on Eloquent models, as well as creating database
        migrations with <a href="https://github.com/beezee/wp-phinx">WP Phinx</a> and Eloquent
        models based on new tables.

        After completing this part of the tutorial, your plugin will include the following
        features:

        <ul>
          <li>A per-user interface for retrieving/resetting an API key and secret</li>
          <li>An endpoint for creating temporary access tokens using 
            an API key and signature based on secret</li>
          <li>Secured access to the API based on the currently logged-in user,
            or a provided access token and the associated user account</li>
        </ul>

        With that outlined, let's get started. If you haven't yet, install and activate
        the <a href="https://github.com/beezee/WPSpokes">WPSpokes</a> plugin on your WordPress
        development installation.

  </div>
  <div class="row lead">
    <hr />
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <h4>Main Plugin File</h4>
      <p>
        Every Wordpress plugin needs a main plugin file. This is where we will put the 
        <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header">plugin headers</a> that allow
        WordPress to recognize it as a plugin. 
        For plugins running on WPSpokes, it needs to do two other things:
        <ol>
          <li>Register a namespace with the WPSpokes autoloader</li>
          <li>Define routes that the plugin will handle</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>Registering with the autoloader</h4>
      <p>
        On line #20, in the static initialize method, we register a namespace with the WPSpokes autoloader.
        The WPSpokes framework exposes itself as a singleton available via the static "instance" method, 
        which gives us the register_namespace method. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the path passed as the second argument here must contain a directory 
        whose name matches the the namespace defined by the first argument. 
        In this case, we are telling the autoloader to map the WPAPI namespace 
        to the WPAPI directory inside our plugin folder. 
        This is the directory where we will put the rest of our code.
      </p>

      <h4>Defining routes that our plugin will handle</h4>
      <p>
        For now we are only defining one route, "/api/posts". We'll get this route to 
        return a JSON blob containing an array of posts, and then move from there to add
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line #15, in the add_routes method, we access the 
        <a href="https://github.com/beezee/PHP-Router">WPSpokes router</a>, 
        then call the map method to define our route, and the controller that will handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we are saying that when someone accesses the "/api/posts" url, it should invoke the index
        method of the PostsController class which lives in the WPAPI/Controllers directory and namespace.
        We'll define this class and method next.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="8b6c29bd386600334377a3c9ddb743c5450e2a08"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row lead">
    <hr />
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <h4>Controller declaration</h4>
      <p>
        While not specific to controllers, it's worth mentioning the namespacing here. 
        WPSpokes uses a <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/">PSR-0</a> based 
        autoloader, so all classes in the plugin should use PSR-0 compliant namespacing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, we are starting from the WPAPI namespace we registered in the main plugin file,
        and moving into the controllers directory, so the namespace is WPAPI\Controllers.
      </p>
      <p>
        All controllers must inherit from \WPSpokes\Framework\Controller. The \WPSpokes\Framework
        namespace contains all framework specific code.
      </p>
      
      <h4>\WPSpokes\Framework\Controller::before()</h4>
      <p>
        On line #7, we declare a before method. This is not required, but be defining it, any code within
        it will be run before a controller method is invoked by the WPSpokes router. The same is true for
        a declared "after" method, which is run after the method invoked by the WPSpokes router.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, we use the before method to set the Content-Type header, so that any methods we
        use as route handlers in this controller will respond with JSON.
      </p>

      <h4>Model retrieval and serialization</h4>
      <p>
        WPSpokes uses <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/eloquent">Eloquent ORM</a> as the basis for the 
        model layer, and provides models for the 
        <a href="https://github.com/beezee/WPSpokes/tree/master/WPSpokes/Framework/Models">
          basic WordPress datatypes
        </a> in the \WPSpokes\Framework\Models namespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        On lines #14-15, we are retrieving all posts in the database, (post_type filtering is handled by
        the \WPSpokes\Framework\Models\Post model,) then outputting serialized JSON representing
        that data set.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point if you've activated the WPSpokes plugin and your new plugin, you should be
        able to navigate your web browser to your Wordpress instance, then visit the "/api/posts" path
        and see a JSON blob representing an array of all of your posts. If you have alot this can be 
        a slow page to load, so next we will add the ability to do some basic filtering at this endpoint.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="52ee70f505555e639ca6c0d62b4e64d075301b28"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        With this small addition we now have the ability to filter based on any attribute values.
        This is useful for several simple groupings, such as showing only draft posts (/api/posts?post_status=draft)
        or showing posts by a specific author (/api/posts?post_author=1). Combinations are possible too, 
        like all drafts by a specific author (/api/posts?post_status=draft&post_author=1).
      </p>
      <p>
        All we've added to make this possible is to use
        <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#basic-usage">Eloquent's query builder</a>
        to loop over any querystring parameters and add query conditions based on them. Thanks
        to Eloquent we don't need to worry about escaping input before sending it to the
        database.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in good shape, let's add the index endpoint for the rest of our data types.
        Because the code for each will look extremely similar, we'll want to do some refactoring
        along the way to avoid creating duplicate code.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="3d97fe5fb50d4bd9d525ccc8715ccd12851983dc"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        What we are doing here is moving most of the work that our PostsController was doing to 
        an abstract \WPAPI\Controllers\APIController class. We've left one method abstract in 
        that class, the "get_model_class" method, which requires any class inheriting from
        the APIController to implement it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows us to inherit from the APIController for all of our different data types, and 
        simply define which model to use for the controller, eliminating any wasteful duplication.
      </p>

      <h4>Dynamic Getters/Setters</h4>
      <p>
        One noteworthy detail of the APIController is its use of a dynamic getter. Notice on line
        #16 of the APIController, a reference to "model_class" as an attribute of the controller instance.
        This is a feature of most objects that inherit from a WPSpokes class, which allows  methods prefixed
        with "get_" or "set_" to be referenced as object properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this refactoring in place it becomes trivial to add the index routes for the rest of our data types.
        We'll do that next.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="c102fa4d27fbdac911aef9a688dddd56bbba5515"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        Following in the pattern of the PostsController, all we have to do is create a controller for each 
        data type, return the correct model class from each controllers "get_model_class" method, and 
        add the routes in the main plugin file.
      </p>
      <p>
        By now you should be able to visit any of the following URLs and see a json representation of the 
        appropriate data:
        <ul>
          <li>/api/posts</li>
          <li>/api/users</li>
          <li>/api/tags</li>
          <li>/api/categories</li>
        </ul>
        At this stage the next thing to do is implement another of our restful endpoints, but first let's
        refactor our route declarations, since they are starting to get long and redundant.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="0da047c8c8da98d281bf4fc916d4b2041ba709ef"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        By moving the route declarations to a parameterized method, we only have to declare each
        endpoint of a resource once, instead of once per data type. By the time we are done, that
        will save us 15 route declarations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next endpoint we will implement is the "show" endpoint, which displays info for a single 
        instance of any data type. Thanks to our refactoring, we only need to add one route declaration
        and one controller method to make this work across all data types.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="f02dec0f6248366858890c977b91840d5061ba95"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        With the above code in place any of the previously listed urls can now be accessed with an ID 
        added to the end to display a single instance. For example, /api/posts/1 will display the post
        with a primary key of 1.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Parameterized routes</h4>
      <p>
       Note on line #17 of the main plugin file, the ":id" token at the end of the declared route.
       This corresponds to the $id parameter accepted by the show method defined on line #24 of the 
       APIController. Parameters in route declarations are indicated by a preceding colon, and are
       passed to the corresponding controller method as arguments in order of appearance in the 
       route definition, from left to right.
      </p>

      <h4>404 Not Found</h4>
      <p>
        The \WPSpokes\Framework\Controller class includes a "set404" method, which sets a 404
        header and displays the 404 page provided by your selected WordPress theme. Here we use it
        when no instance is found with the provided primary key, on line #28 of the APIController.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we will add the "create" endpoint, using the same approach as for the "show" 
        endpoint, one route declaration and one controller method.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <div class="diff" data-sha="db6fd754324a6868a1eb5c5bb145da1c9cd2ee2e"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="row lead">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <p>
        With mostly more of the same, we now have a working create endpoint for each of our data types.
        One thing to note on lines #17 and #22 of the main plugin file, we've added an extra parameter to the
        call to the map method on the WPSpokes router, specifying which actions should be accepted for each
        mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is necessary because the create and index endpoints share the same url, differing only in
        request action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note we used "create_new" as the method name on the controller. This is because the 
        \WPSpokes\Framework\Controller class already inherits a create method for a different purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now test creating models using curl at the terminal. Here's how I've tested with a category:
        <pre>
          curl -X POST http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/ \
            -d '{"name":"A Brand New Category"}'

          -> {
              "taxonomy":"category","term_id":27,"term_taxonomy_id":25,
              "name":"A Brand New Category","slug":"a-brand-new-category"
             }
        </pre>
      </p>
      
      <h4>Guarded Attributes</h4>
      <p>
        You may notice if you try to create a user that you get a user object with validation errors as a response.
        This is because our create endpoint uses massive assignment to pass attributes in on object instantiation
        (line #36 of APIController) and the \WPSpokes\Framework\Models\User model defines user_pass as a "guarded"
        attribute. This means it cannot be massively assigned.
      </p>
      <pre>
        curl -X POST http://local.wordpress.dev/api/users/ -d \
          '{"user_login":"testuser", "user_pass":"test_pass",
          "display_name":"Test User", "user_email":"test@test.com"}'

        -> {
            "user_login":"testuser","display_name":"Test User",
            "user_email":"test@test.com","user_registered":"2014-04-27 04:37:41",
            "user_nicename":"test-user",
            "errors":{"user_pass":["User Pass is required"]}
           }
      </pre>
      <p>
        For this particular use case, it might be considered a desired behavior, since we probably don't want
        people creating accounts using the API. In fact, when we come to securing the API towards the end of the
        tutorial, we'll restrict the user endpoints to admins only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our last two updates are very similar, and should be familiar by now, so we'll knock them out in one
        step, but first a small refactoring to prevent us from having to write the same code more than once.

      <p>
        There are two things we accomplish here. First, we replace lines #26 to #29 of the APIController
        with a call to our newly defined "find_or_404" method, which we will re-use in both of our remaining
        endpoints.

        Second, we replace lines #34 and #36 with a call to our newly defined "get_params" method. Note again 
        that we are leveraging the WPSpokes provided virtual attribute behavior and referencing params as an
        instance property in the "create_new" method.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this in place, our last two endpoints are very concise.

        As promised, there's not a whole lot of code required at this point for our last two endpoints.
        A few small things worth noting, we again add a third param to our previous "show" route
        declaration to make room for our PUT and DELETE variations on the same url.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the Eloquent ORM provided "fill" method on line #55 of the APIController to massively assign
        an array of attributes to an existing instance. This acheives the same result as passing parameters
        to a model constructor, but in this case we are updating an existing record, so we don't directly
        call the constructor in our code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how I tested these new endpoints (note the delete endpoint will actually destroy a row from 
        your database.)
      </p>

      <pre>curl -X POST http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/ \
  -d '{"name":"A Category to Test"}'

-> {
    "taxonomy":"category","term_id":30,"term_taxonomy_id":28,
    "name":"A Category to Test","slug":"a-category-to-test"
   }

curl http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/28/

-> {
    "term_taxonomy_id":"28","term_id":"30","taxonomy":"category",
    "description":"","parent":"0","count":"0",
    "name":"A Category to Test","slug":"a-category-to-test"
   }

curl -X PUT http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/28/ \
  -d '{"description":"This is just for testing"}' 

-> {
    "term_taxonomy_id":"28","term_id":"30","taxonomy":"category",
    "description":"This is just for testing","parent":"0","count":"0",
    "name":"A Category to Test","slug":"a-category-to-test"
   }

curl -X DELETE http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/28/

-> {
    "term_taxonomy_id":"28","term_id":"30","taxonomy":"category",
    "description":"This is just for testing","parent":"0","count":"0",
    "name":"A Category to Test","slug":"a-category-to-test"
   }

curl http://local.wordpress.dev/api/categories/28/

-> 404
